# CPP Module 00 - Introduction to C++ 

This module introduces the foundational concepts and syntax of C++, laying the groundwork for more complex projects in future modules.

## Overview

The module consists of three exercises, each designed to build familiarity with C++ syntax, classes, and basic programming practices:

### Exercise 00: C++ Syntax
The goal of this exercise is to create a simple program that converts lowercase letters to uppercase. This task serves as an introduction to the syntax of C++ and provides hands-on experience with basic operations, input/output handling, and character manipulation.

#### Key Learning Points:
- Understanding the structure of a C++ program.
- Using input (`std::cin`) and output (`std::cout`) streams.

### Exercise 01: Building a Simple PhoneBook
This exercise introduces object-oriented programming by requiring the creation of two classes: `PhoneBook` and `Contact`. 

#### Objectives:
- Implement a `PhoneBook` class that allows users to add and display contacts.
- Create a `Contact` class to store simple details like:
  - Name
  - Phone number
  - Other personal details (e.g., nickname, email, or address).

Users will be able to:
- Add new contacts.
- Display a summary of existing contacts.
- Search for and view individual contact details.

#### Key Learning Points:
- Understanding and implementing classes.
- Managing data encapsulation and member functions.
- Using arrays or containers to store multiple objects.

### Exercise 02: Matching Declarations with Definitions
In this exercise, a `.hpp` file containing function declarations and expected output results is provided. The task is to create a matching `.cpp` file that implements the functions to meet the specified requirements.

#### Objectives:
- Implement functions that adhere to predefined prototypes.
- Ensure that the program's output matches the expected results described in the `.hpp` file.

#### Key Learning Points:
- Working with header (`.hpp`) and implementation (`.cpp`) files.
- Understanding function declarations and definitions.
- Gaining experience with debugging and verifying program output.

## How to Run the Exercises
All exercises have Makefile which can be run with make command.
